This is my first django project.
I created online-store for b2b sales.

The uniques of this platform - simplest add product to site:
for example, i used the 'Microinform' distributor site for price-list download,
next step - program parsing description, specification and product photo,
from vendor site (i chose "D-Link" vendor - it's telecommunication equipments)
and add it to site.

The site also supports such standard functions as:
 * authorization,
 * adding items to the cart,
 * generating invoices in pdf,
 * page display,
 * search.
